            Keep devices stored securely. Always lock your devices using either fingerprint recognition, a secure PIN
            (not something obvious like your date of birth) or a unique gesture. Install Find My iPhone (Apple) or set
            up Find My Device (Android) </p>

        <p>Hacking prevention
            You can protect yourself against hackers by following good cybersecurity hygiene. Here are some key hacking
            prevention tips to bear in mind:<br>

            Use strong passwords
            A big part of hacking is getting hold of users' passwords. It is therefore essential to use a strong and
            unique password for each online account. A strong password is made up of at least 12 characters – ideally
            more – and is a mix of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers and special characters. It can be difficult
            keeping track of multiple passwords, so using a password manager can help.<br>

            Use multi-factor authentication (MFA)
            Turn on two-factor or multi-factor authentication for as many of your online accounts as possible. MFA uses
            a second piece of information – often a code generated by an app or sent via SMS – alongside a password,
            adding another layer of security to your accounts.<br>
